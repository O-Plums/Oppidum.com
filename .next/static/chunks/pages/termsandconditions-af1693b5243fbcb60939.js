It\u2019s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone\u2019s security features and it could mean that the Oppidum app won\u2019t work properly or at all.\n\nThe app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.\n\nLink to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the app\n\n*   [Google Play Services](https://policies.google.com/terms)\n*   [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics)\n*   [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics)\n*   [Sentry](https://sentry.io/terms/)\n\nYou should be aware that there are certain things that O-plums will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but O-plums cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don\u2019t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don\u2019t have any of your data allowance left.\n\nIf you\u2019re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you\u2019re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you\u2019re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.\n\nAlong the same lines, O-plums cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged \u2013 if it runs out of battery and you can\u2019t turn it on to avail the Service, O-plums cannot accept responsibility.\n\nWith respect to O-plums\u2019s responsibility for your use of the app, when you\u2019re using the app, it\u2019s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you.

However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
